				Deforestation in African is accountable for about 3% of the worlds co2 emissions. When a tree is cut down, not only does it stop absorbing Carbon Dioxide, it also releases the stored co2 into the atmosphere if the wood is burned or left to rot after the logging.  
				Some of the agricultural crops do absorb a small amount of co2 but trees can store a vast amount more. 
				Studies show that over 1.5 billion tons of carbon dioxide is released into the atmosphere because of deforestation. 
				If deforestation continues at its current rate, we will notice a drastic change in our climate over the next decade. 
				Unfortunately, there isnt much economic incentive to preserve these forests. However, there are plans to start a global economy that puts value on the carbon stored in forests, meaning that developing nations can earn as much income by preserving their forests than they do by destroying them.

					<li> 
					Half the worlds tropical forests have been cleared or degraded. Every hour, at least 4,500 acres of forest fall to chain saws, machetes, flames, or bulldozers.
					</li>
					<li>
					Fuelwood in Sub-Saharan Africa is consumed at a rate of 30-200% greater than the average annual grow of trees.
					</li>
					<li>
					Worldwide, 1.6 billion people rely on forest products for all or part of their livelihoods.
					</li>
					<li>
					Trees provide an important ecosystem function by storing carbon, a cause of climate change, in their biomass (wood, leaves, and roots).
