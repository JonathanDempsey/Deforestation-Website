				<h1>Effects of Deforestation</h1>

					Deforestation has been a serious issue over the past decade. 
					Trees in the Brazilian Rainforest are been cut down at an excessive rate to make room for plantations and residential areas. 
					Although this may be good for those who benefit from it, the long term effects are much more troublesome. The trees create a high soil fertility factor, which is one of the reasons they are cut down for agriculture. 
					However, with the loss of the trees roots holding the soil together, this can lead to flooding and landslides from loose soil. With the trees gone this creates some environmental issues such as water pollution and increased CO2 in the atmosphere. 
					
					</p>
					<p>
					Deforestation also affects the Indigenous tribes of Africa, moving them from their ancestral homeland. 
					Although some of these issues have been put into the spot light in media, deforestation is still an issue that must be resolved. There are active groups trying to stop deforestation such as Arborday Foundation, the ActNow group and the Grameen Foundation. 
					These groups rely on volunteers with a passion for the environment to help prevent deforestation. 
					The cons of deforestation vastly outweigh the pros, and so something must be done.

				<h2>Effects on the Climate</h2>
				
				<p>
				Deforestation in African is accountable for about 3% of the worlds co2 emissions. 
				When a tree is cut down, not only does it stop absorbing Carbon Dioxide, it also releases the stored co2 into the atmosphere if the wood is burned or left to rot after the logging.  
				Some of the agricultural crops do absorb a small amount of co2 but trees can store a vast amount more. Studies show that over 1.5 billion tons of carbon dioxide is released into the atmosphere because of deforestation. 
				If deforestation continues at its current rate, we will notice a drastic change in our climate over the next decade. Unfortunately, there isnt much economical incentive to preserve these forests. 
				However, there are plans to start a global economy that puts value on the carbon stored in forests, meaning that developing nations can earn as much income by preserving their forests than they do by destroying them.
